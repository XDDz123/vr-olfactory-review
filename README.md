# VR Olfactory Review
This paper examines the current state of the research and development of olfactory devices for virtual reality. This review attempts to answer whether a comprehensive olfactory device is feasible with current technology by covering the following subtopics:
* The mechanisms and features of olfaction & olfactory perception
* The current state of olfactory display research & development

The article cited almost 50 peer-reviewed sources (and even more were examined throughout the writing process), which hopefully should provide a comprehensive starting point into VR olfaction research for the uninitiated.
